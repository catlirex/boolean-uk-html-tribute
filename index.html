      <h2>His story</h2>
      <p>
        Kobe Born in Philadelphia and partly raised in Italy, Bryant was
        recognized as the top high-school basketball player in the U.S. while at
        Lower Merion High School in Pennsylvania. The son of former NBA player
        Joe Bryant, he declared for the 1996 NBA draft after graduation, and was
        selected by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick; the
        Hornets then traded him to the Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned a
        reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 Slam
        Dunk Contest, and he was named an All-Star by his second season. Despite
        a feud with teammate Shaquille O'Neal, the pair led the Lakers to three
        consecutive NBA championships from 2000 to 2002. In 2003, Bryant was
        charged with sexual assault following an accusation by a young female
        hotel clerk. The criminal charges were dropped after the accuser refused
        to testify, and a lawsuit was settled out of court. Bryant issued a
        public apology and admitted to a sexual encounter but denied the assault
        allegation and said it was consensual.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the Lakers lost the 2004 NBA Finals, O'Neal was traded and Bryant
        became the cornerstone of the Lakers. He led the NBA in scoring during
        the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons. In 2006, he scored a career-high 81
        points; the second most points scored in a single game in league
        history, behind Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. Bryant led
        the team to two consecutive championships in 2009 and 2010, and was
        named NBA Finals MVP on both occasions. He continued to be among the top
        players in the league through 2013, when he suffered a torn Achilles
        tendon at age 34. He subsequently suffered season-ending injuries to his
        knee and shoulder, respectively, in the following two seasons. Citing
        physical decline, Bryant retired after the 2015–16 season.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bryant is the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history. He
        was also the first guard in NBA history to play at least 20 seasons. His
        18 All-Star designations are the second most all time, while it is the
        record for most consecutive appearances as a starter. Bryant's four
        All-Star Game MVP Awards are tied with Bob Pettit for the most in NBA
        history. He gave himself the nickname "Black Mamba" in the mid-2000s,
        and the epithet became widely adopted by the general public. At the 2008
        and 2012 Summer Olympics, he won two gold medals as a member of the U.S.
        national team. In 2018, he won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short
        Film for his 2017 film Dear Basketball.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bryant died at age 41, along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and
        seven others, in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California in 2020.[9]
        A number of tributes and memorials were subsequently issued, including
        renaming the All-Star Game MVP Award in his honor.
